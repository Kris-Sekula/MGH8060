There are also a few demo programs that can be uploaded via Kitbug+ "S" command and executed with the "G" command (filename indicates the upload and execution address)

## Big thanks to "Retro Phil" who has been maintaining the Kitbug+ firmware and adapted it to the new memory mapping on this PCB, he has also created the "selection menu" for MGH8060... you can follow his adventures with SC/MP on his [page](https://www.mccrash-racing.co.uk/philg/picl/picl.htm).
